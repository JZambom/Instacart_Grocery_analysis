# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on an analysis conducted for Instacart, an online grocery store operating through an app. The main objective was to uncover deeper insights into customer purchasing patterns and inform targeted marketing strategies to boost sales.

## Background and Context
Instacart has experienced strong sales but aims to optimize its marketing and sales strategies through data-driven insights. The analysis targets understanding customer diversity, purchasing behaviors, and the busiest times for orders. This project serves as the foundation for segmenting customers and developing targeted marketing campaigns that align with customer preferences.

## Key Objectives
The project sought to answer essential questions, such as:
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day for orders?
- When do customers tend to spend the most money?
- Which product departments see the highest order frequency?
- How do customer loyalty, region, age, and family status influence ordering behavior?
- What customer classifications emerge from demographic data and purchasing habits?

## Stakeholders
- **Vice President of Marketing**: Focused on improving targeted ad campaigns.
- **Senior Vice President of Sales**: Interested in identifying market share gaps and ways to enhance sales.
- **Instacart Customers**: Seek relevant ads, promotions, and product recommendations based on their regular orders.

## Methodology and Tools
- **Analysis Environment**: Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda for package management.
- **Programming Language**: Python, using libraries such as `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `seaborn`.
- **Techniques Applied**:
  - Data wrangling, cleaning, and type adjustments.
  - Creating new variables and performing data merges.
  - Implementing descriptive statistics and data visualization (histograms, bar charts, line plots, scatter plots).
  - Grouping and aggregating data to derive meaningful insights.
- **Data Ethics**: Ensured customer data handling adhered to ethical standards.

## Deliverables
The project includes:
- Python scripts with clean, commented code for reproducibility.
- Comprehensive data visualizations to present findings effectively.
